# CNN-Image-Classifier

In this project, we aim to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image classification. The goal of the model is to accurately classify images into predefined categories based on their visual features. The project involves training the model on a large dataset of labeled images, optimizing the model's performance using various techniques, and evaluating its accuracy on a held-out test set. The outcome of this project will be a robust image classification model that can be used for a variety of real-world applications
